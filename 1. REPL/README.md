# REPL

REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, and it's a great way to explore the Node.js features in a quick way.

## Open your Gitbash and run

```bash
  node
```

Now you can write Javascript code on your terminal!
Example:

```bash
  > console.log("Hello World");
```

```bash
  > const name = "Drian";
```

```bash
  > name
```

Type '.help' for more information

```bash
  > .help
```

To exit REPL you can run

```bash
  > .exit
```

## Load file js

```bash
  > .load file.js
```

## Save REPL to file js

```bash
  > .save namefile.js
```

## Break

```bash
  > .break
```

example

```bash
  > const sayHello = (name, age) => {
  ... .break
```

## Open editor REPL

```bash
  > .editor
```
